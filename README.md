# Title - Eyes infinite
Eyes exercise with some upgrades to give it the feel of an infinite tsukuyomi theme.

### escription
Eye tracking single page application to showcase basic event processing. I have added additional styling and theme to this project.

While I had several cool ideas, like laser eyes, I stuck with Naruto's theme of Tsukuyomi. That show in particular had unique designs for the eyes, so I figured that it would be fun to implement. Basic preface is that a person is able to project their eye unto the moon and hypnotize everyone. Hope this mezmerizes you as well.
